## MANIFESTO

In the digital age, we are obsessed with permanence. We archive, backup, screenshot - desperately clinging to every byte. **The Entropy Browser** challenges this obsession with a radical concept: **ephemeral memory**.

This is not an app. It's a meditation on loss.

Type a thought. Watch it materialize as physical letters that obey gravity. See them pile up like fragments of the past. Move your cursor through the debris and scatter the remains. Eventually, everything fades, just like real memories.

**Built for [Dreamware 2025](https://dreamwarehack.com)** - where digital experiences meet philosophical inquiry.

## FEATURES

### Physics-Driven Typography
Every letter you type becomes a rigid body with real physical properties:
- Mass, friction, and restitution
- Gravity pulls them down to pile at the bottom
- Walls contain the chaos within the viewport

### Fluid Background
A GLSL shader-based energy field that evolves organically over time.
- Mathematical noise patterns create a "breathing" effect
- Reacts to time, creating a subtle, hypnotic backdrop
- "Alive" visuals that never repeat exactly

### Generative Soundscapes
The system speaks back through audio:
- **Ambient Drone**: A low-frequency hum that grounds the experience
- **Reactive Typing**: Unique sound samples for keystrokes, pitched randomly to create a non-repetitive melody
- **Mute Control**: Toggle the auditory hallucinations at will

### Interactive Decay
Your cursor creates a repulsion field that scatters the debris of your memories. Move through the fallen letters and watch them scatter like disturbed thoughts.

### Atmospheric Design
- **CRT Scanlines**: subtle retro display artifacts
- **Vignette Overlay**: dramatic edge darkening
- **Glowing Text**: ethereal letter rendering with shadows
- **Custom Cursor**: crosshair design that enhances the mood
- **Ambient Particles**: floating dust in the void

### Live Statistics
- Track fragments still falling in real-time
- Count letters lost to entropy forever

### Key Design Decisions

- **Custom Hooks Architecture**: Separation of physics logic (`usePhysicsEngine`) and rendering (`useCanvasRenderer`) for clean, maintainable code
- **Canvas Rendering**: Direct canvas manipulation for 60fps performance with hundreds of physics bodies
- **Memoized Components**: All UI components wrapped with `memo()` to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Throttled State Updates**: Physics state updates throttled to 100ms to prevent React overwhelm

## THEMING

The color system uses **OKLCH color space** for perceptual uniformity:

```css
--color-background: oklch(0.07 0 0);        /* Deep black */
--color-foreground: oklch(0.91 0.01 270);   /* Soft white */
--color-muted: oklch(0.7 0.02 270 / 0.85);  /* Dimmed text */
--color-accent: oklch(0.77 0.02 270 / 0.9); /* Highlighted elements */
```

## PHILOSOPHY

The Entropy Browser is an **anti-app**. In a world of infinite scrollback, cloud sync, and "memories" features, this project asks: *what if we designed for forgetting?*

Every interaction is a small act of letting go:
- **Type**: acknowledge a thought
- **Watch it fall**: feel the weight of memory
- **Scatter the debris**: disturb the settled past
- **See it fade**: accept impermanence

This is software as meditation. A digital memento mori.
