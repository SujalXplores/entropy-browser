## The Vision

**DreamWare** Hackathon 2025 invites you to blur the line between technology and imagination to build experiences that don't just serve users, but _haunt_ them a little.

Today's apps are functional, logical, and optimized, but rarely _alive_. What if we brought dreams back into code? What if software could whisper, mutate, or feel instead of just _work_?

Dreams are the oldest software our minds ever ran, self-generating worlds built from fragments of memory and emotion. They're nonsensical, yet meaningful. Fleeting, yet vivid.

**Keywords:** Dreamware | Digital Imagination | Alive Interfaces

---

## The Brief

Build an app, experience, or digital world that behaves like a **dream**. Surreal, nonlinear, emotional, or self-aware.

It could be playful, meditative, haunting, or simply beautiful, as long as it makes people feel something real through something unreal.

Think of it as a creative rebellion against "productivity software."

**Your goal: turn emotion into interaction.**

## Dream Fragments

*(Choose 1+ Features to Implement)*

These are like _dream fragments_ you can add to your project to enrich it (and maybe get some brownie points!). Under every fragment, there are examples. You won't necessarily implement exactly these, but something LIKE them.

### 1. Fluid Interface

UI that behaves organically. Shifting, breathing, reacting to user emotion or time.

**Examples:**
- Buttons that drift slowly across the screen.
- Menus that blur when ignored too long.
- Colors that change based on your typing rhythm.

### 2. Emotional Memory

Your app remembers feelings, not data.

**Examples:**
- Users' previous moods affect the next experience.
- Joy, fear, or calmness alter what the system shows.
- Dream-history screen: a map of your emotional trail.

### 3. Temporal Shifts

Time behaves strangely inside your creation.

**Examples:**
- Screens decay if you stay too long.
- Content rearranges itself each visit.
- Every reload feels like waking from a new dream.

### 4. Voice of the Machine

Let your system _speak back_, literally or symbolically.

**Examples:**
- AI conversation or narration of events.
- Reactive soundscapes that reply to user actions.
- Text that types itself like it's thinking.

### 5. Metamorphic Media

Nothing stays static, visuals, sounds, or data morph in real time.

**Examples:**
- Images that evolve with interaction.
- Music that adapts to pace or silence.
- Interfaces that dissolve or rebuild as you explore.

> Each feature you add should feel _alive_, unpredictable, and slightly insane, the kind of logic only dreams understand.

---

## Technical Pathways

### Analyse
- Build surreal interactive sites with **React**, **Next.js**, or **Vanilla JS + CSS animations**.
- Use **Canvas / WebGL / Three.js / p5.js** for evolving visuals or generative dreamscapes.

### Audio-Visual Art
- Create **music-reactive environments** using **Tone.js** or **WebAudio API**.
- Experiment with **text-to-sound** or **AI voice modulation** to give your dream a voice.

### AI/ML-Infused Dreams
- Generate dream imagery or poetry using **Stable Diffusion / GPT / text models**.
- Build adaptive experiences that respond to sentiment or user behavior.

### Experimental Mediums
- Command-line "dream simulators" with ASCII art and auto-generated text.
- **Browser extensions** that subtly distort your daily browsing.
- **AR/VR portals** — step into a lucid dream through your screen.

> However you approach it, the goal is the same: **Make your software _feel sentient_.**

## F.A.Q.

*Find answers to the most common questions about **Dreamware 2025** — from registration and team setup to submission rules and judging criteria. Everything you need to start dreaming in code.*

**What's the team size limit?**  
You can participate solo or in teams. We recommend 2−5 people for optimal coordination during the 72 hours, but there's no strict maximum.

**Can I use pre-existing code?**  
Libraries and frameworks are fine, but your core concept and implementation must be original work created during the hackathon. No repurposing existing projects.

**How do I submit my project?**  
Submission details and the form will be shared closer to the deadline (December 1). Make sure you're in our Discord for updates.

**Are Dream Fragments mandatory?**  
No. They're optional inspiration. You can implement one, several, or none—focus on creating something emotionally resonant.

**Can I work on my project before November 28?**  
No. All development must happen during the 72-hour hackathon window (Nov 28 — Dec 1). Planning and research beforehand are allowed.

**What if my project isn't "functional" in a traditional sense?**  
Perfect. DreamWare celebrates experiences over utility. If it evokes emotion or creates atmosphere, you're on the right track.

**How does Community Choice voting work?**  
After main judging (Dec 13), the public votes Dec 13-20 on their favorite project. The winner receives an additional $500 prize.
